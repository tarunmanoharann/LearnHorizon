## About the Project

This project uses a template that provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules. It utilizes React with TypeScript for type safety and Vite for fast development and building.

Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
